  <li>browser compatibility
    <ul>
      <li>marc says: Of course, we would have to support IE and Netscape, though
        which versions I'm not sure of.&nbsp; More broadly, I'd love to support
        Mozilla and Opera. &nbsp;(I saw Opera used in Russia.)</li>
      <li>kevin says: Enough people disable Javascript on their regular browsers
        that I don't think we can require it for the site to function. If there
        are certain features that would be greatly enhanced with a dab of
        Javascript, that seems ok to me.</li>
      <li>kevin says: we should also attempt to be compatible with AOL, WebTV,
        ancient versions of IE and Netscape, and all the other oddball browsers
        past and future. Not that we need to test with them, but that we should
        aim for a site that is as simple and widely compatible as possible.</li>
      <li>kevin says: <span class="288075021-14112002">I think our goal should
        be to rely as little as possible on browser features, so that the Amp
        can be used by as many people as possible. We should use little or no
        Javascript, because it is notoriously hard to debug, is notoriously
        incompatible between browser versions, and is disabled by many people
        for security and/or privacy reasons.&nbsp;</span></li>
      <li>kevin says: <span class="288075021-14112002">Also, there are different
        levels of compatibility. At a minimum, the site should not crash or be
        invisible on a supported browser. But some amount of cosmetic
        imperfection is probably ok, because it is almost impossible to get
        certain HTML features to look good on all versions of all browsers,
        without extensive browser-specific code. I would like to avoid serving
        different pages for different browsers if at all possible.</span></li>
      <li>kevin says: <span class="288075021-14112002">We need further
        discussions, but my own first thought is that the absolute minimum to
        fully support would be Windows versions of IE 5, 5.5 and 6, Mac IE&nbsp;[don't
        know which version(s)]&nbsp;and Netscape 4.7 and 6.2, and Linux Netscape
        4.7 and 6.2.&nbsp;</span></li>
      <li><span class="288075021-14112002">kevin says: </span><span class="288075021-14112002">I
        would also like to support Lynx (a text-only browser), and the latest
        version of Opera on all three platforms. ... As for Lynx, I'm not sure
        it's a marketing requirement. And I certainly wouldn't propose making it
        actually look good in a text-only browser. But if we stick to simple,
        validated standard HTML, it should be at least functional under Lynx
        with no effort on our part. Partly this would be in line with some of
        Benetech's other goals, which are accessibility by blind folks, and
        compatibility with low-end Linux systems that might be in use around the
        world.</span></li>
