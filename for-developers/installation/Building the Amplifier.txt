Instructions for Building the Amplifier from Eclipse
----------------------------------------------------

1. Compilation: Eclipse can be set up to automatically build java sources.
 You can also manually build amplifier  by selecting the project you want 
 to build and selecting "Rebuild Project" from the popup menu.

2. The project is now set up to automatically run martus-amplifier/build.xml
any time a file in the project is saved. This consists of jar-ing up the 
martus common source files and putting it and some 3rd-party jars in the 
WEB-INF/lib directory. 

3. After performing these steps you should be able to run and test the 
Amplifier. See "Running the Amplifier" and "Testing the Amplifier".
