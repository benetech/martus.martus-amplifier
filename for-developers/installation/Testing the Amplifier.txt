Instructions for Testing the Amplifier from Eclipse
----------------------------------------------------

I. Follow the instructions for setting up the Martus Server in 
"Running the Amplifier". You will also need to make sure the 
MartusAmplifierServer is running before running the tests. 
Some day it might be nice to have the amplifier test automatically 
start the MartusAmplifierServer on setUp() and stop it when the tests 
are completed. Or possibly have the tests be able to run without an 
actual MartusAmplifierServer running, by creating a dummy network endpoint.

II. Set up a JUnit Launch Configuration.

1. Go to "Run"->"Run...".

2. Under "Launch Configurations" select "JUnit" and "New".

3. Fill in the following fields:

	Name: TestAllAmplifier
	Project: martus-amplifier
	Main class: org.martus.amplifier.test.TestAllAmplifier

4. Run it. Wait for results.

5. This Launch Configuration is now saved and can be used for future test 
execution.
