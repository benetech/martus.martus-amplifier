I: Setting up the server and test data

1) The servers need a keypair file and a particular directory structure.
- To generate a keypair run:
org.martus.server.tools.CreateKeyPair --keypair=<pathToKeypair>

Then enter a passphrase & it will write out the keypair.dat 
to the path specified. 
Note: pathTokeypair should the path to the filename. 
eg: C:\MartusServer\deleteOnStartup\keypair.dat

2- Place the generated keypair into C:\MartusServer\deleteOnStartup\

3- Run the server at org.martus.server.foramplifiers.MartusAmplifierServer,
enter your passphrase & the server will be running on 
https://127.0.0.1:985


II) Modify Configuration/BackupServer.properties

Set serverName and serverIP = 127.0.0.1 
Set Port Number as 985
Set publickey = The public key is the key that gets displayed 
as "ServerAccount" on the console when you start the Martus Server 

We may want to change this to Public code?(cml)

III) Setting up servertest data
The server test data(packets directory) should be copied to 
C:\MartusServer.
Note: Make sure that packets directory has the acctmap.txt.sig file.
