            <h3>What is Martus?</h3>
            <h4><a name="1"></a>What is the Martus mission? </h4>
            <p>Martus is a technology tool to assist the human rights sector in 
              the collection, safeguarding, organization and dissemination of 
              information about human rights violations. Martus brings the power 
              of technology to the field by placing a simple yet powerful tool 
              into the hands of human rights defenders around the globe. With 
              the Martus system, documentation of human rights violations will 
              be safeguarded and disseminated, accelerating response to violations 
              and in some cases preventing additional abuses.</p>
            <p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
            <h4><a name="2"></a>Who is building, marketing and implementing Martus? 
            </h4>
            <p>The Martus Project is a major initiative of Benetech, Silicon Valley&#8217;s 
              leading high tech nonprofit. We combine the technology enterprise 
              model with the social mission and heart of the nonprofit sector. 
              As such, we see the grassroots organizations in the human rights 
              sector as Martus customers, and seek to build tools that address 
              their specific needs.</p>
            <p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
            <h4><a name="3"></a>Who uses Martus? </h4>
            <p>The Martus user community is made up of three distinct audiences: 
              information producers, trusted intermediaries and information consumers.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Information producers &#8211; grassroots organizations, NGOs, 
                and other reporting bodies &#8211; use Martus client tools to 
                create and file bulletins concerning human rights abuses. AAAS 
                (American Association for the Advancement of Science) estimates 
                that there are about 10,000 human rights NGOs throughout the world 
                that are actively collecting information in the field.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Trusted intermediaries are leading institutions in the field 
                that operate Martus servers, providing secure and confidential 
                backup services to the information producers.<br>
                &nbsp;</li>
              <li>Information consumers &#8211; academics, the media, and larger 
                human rights organizations &#8211; will use Martus to research, 
                study, and report on human rights abuses.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
            <h4><a name="4"></a>How does the Martus team know what these customers 
              need? </h4>
            <p>The Martus team has met with numerous international human rights 
              organizations such as Human Rights Watch, Lawyer&#8217;s Committee 
              for Human Rights, Open Society Institute, Open Society Archive, 
              United Nations, and AAAS (American Association for the Advancement 
              of Science), as well as grassroots organizations from more than 
              a dozen countries. In addition, we have conducted market research 
              in Russia, Sri Lanka, Cambodia and Guatemala, incorporating the 
              recommendations of human rights activists into the product design. 
              After initial development, Martus entered an extended test period 
              with field-testing in Sri Lanka, Guatemala, Russia and Eastern Europe. 
              By working closely with grassroots and international human rights 
              groups during the conception and development of Martus, Benetech 
              created a tool that addresses the needs of many organizations in 
              the field.</p>
            <p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
            <h4><a name="5"></a>How much funding did Martus require? </h4>
            <p>Martus required an initial investment of approximately $650,000 
              for development of the software. This has been provided by major 
              grants from ASPiration/Open Society Institute and high technology 
              leaders, as well as significant funding from Benetech. A similar 
              amount will be required over the next two years to launch the initiative 
              and provide outreach, training and support to initial users. Subsequently, 
              Martus will be funded by revenue generated from providing customization 
              tools for larger NGOs and from providing ASP and training services 
              for server operations. This revenue will cover the costs of continued 
              Open Source development on a limited scale. </p>
            <p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
            <h4><a name="6"></a>What is the central product of Martus? </h4>
            <p>Most grassroots organizations focus on the development of one central 
              asset: information about the human rights violations they are organized 
              to combat. Like any industry sector where data is the product, human 
              rights monitors and activists must have dependable, secure systems 
              in place for the collection, storage and retrieval of raw data.</p>
            <p> Once this data is available, information consumers such as activists, 
              prosecutors, the media and academics, can analyze the data, study 
              it, and publish reports about it or take direct action such as prosecutions 
              or investigations.</p>
            <p> To provide an end-to-end system for human rights abuse information 
              processing, Martus will consist of three key software components:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>The Martus Client Software</b> provides human rights workers 
                with a simple tool to create text-based bulletins about violations 
                and use built-in encryption to safeguard the data; </li>
              <li><b>The Martus Backup Server</b> accepts encrypted bulletins, 
                securely backs them up and replicates them to multiple locations, 
                safeguarding the information from loss; and </li>
              <li><b>The Martus Bulletin Amplifier</b> provides consumers of human 
                rights information with access to the non-confidential portions 
                of bulletins.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
            <h4><a name="7"></a>What kind of human rights violation reports are 
              we talking about? </h4>
            <p>Martus will be used to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> Document torture, arbitrary execution, detainment and related 
                political rights </li>
              <li>Fight violence and other abuses against women </li>
              <li>Build cases against the perpetrators of genocide </li>
              <li>Communicate instances of electoral abuses and violence </li>
              <li>Help families locate missing relatives </li>
              <li>Locate environmental abuses </li>
              <li>Monitor ethnic and religious abuses </li>
              <li>Combat abuses of gays and lesbians </li>
              <li>Expose public corruption</li>
              <li> And potentially assist almost any grassroots social justice 
                effort involved in monitoring or documentation </li>
            </ul>
            <p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
            <h4><a name="8"></a>Is Martus an activist organization? </h4>
            <p>No, Martus is not itself an activist organization or an urgent 
              action network, but rather a tool addressing the specific technological 
              needs in the human rights community. The Martus Project is a nonpartisan 
              initiative that acts solely to provide a technological service to 
              help human rights information organizations. Martus is not affiliated 
              with any government and is independent of the nongovernmental organizations 
              that it serves.</p>
            <p class="small"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a><br>
              &nbsp; </p>
            <h3>Martus Technology and Security</h3>
            <h4><a name="9"></a>How does technology help human rights? </h4>
            <p> With Martus, human rights NGOs will have access to the information 
              technology tools they need to manage their most important asset: 
              information about human rights abuses. By carefully making the tools 
              usable to someone with basic experience with electronic mail, the 
              technology currently available to more powerful entities will be 
              made accessible to the activist community. NGOs need the ability 
              to 1) create files using a consistent model that can be formatted 
              to satisfy their reporting needs, 2) store and secure reports, and 
              3) access and retrieve files efficiently and securely.</p>
            <p> The need for secure storage and backup to counter possible attacks 
              on saved information is a vital component of the Martus solution. 
              During field research, we found that threats to information can 
              vary from equipment theft to user error to environmental factors. 
              At one human rights organization in Sri Lanka, termites ate seven 
              years of collected violation information that was stored in paper 
              form! Currently, Guatemalan NGOs are experiencing a string of thefts 
              of computers. Any solution must take these real life examples and 
              more into consideration.</p>
            <p> Dissemination of information, both locally and globally, is vital 
              to human rights NGOs. Groups need to share within their own organizations 
              both locally and throughout the world, as well as with the media, 
              INGOs and other information consumers, including emigrants, activists, 
              foreign ministries and citizens of the country where the group is 
              active. Martus will make all of this possible.</p>
            <p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
            <h4><a name="10"></a>Is Martus easy to use? </h4>
            <p> Yes. Because potential Martus users have varied levels of technical 
              ability, Martus tools are built on very basic platforms and systems 
              and use software design elements aimed at the user who has basic 
              computer skills, such as the ability to use a simple email program.</p>
            <p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
            <h4><a name="11"></a>What does open source have to do with Martus? 
            </h4>
            <p>What is open source software, and why is it important? Open source 
              software can be loosely defined as software building blocks that 
              are distributed free of charge as either source code or in compiled 
              form. </p>
            <p>The basic idea behind open source is very simple: when programmers 
              can read, redistribute, and modify the source code for a piece of 
              software, the software is more trustworthy and evolves more quickly 
              than in proprietary software development. Learn more about <a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.html" target="_blank">open 
              source here</a>.</p>
            <p> Martus tools are designed as open source software programs, built 
              on top of open source tools. Martus customers will see three distinct 
              advantages to the open source implementation:</p>
            <ol>
              <li> Potential Martus users or designated experts working on their 
                behalf can examine the code. The Martus commitment to open source 
                allows this examination.</li>
              <li> Through the use of open source tools, Martus will be offered 
                as free software. Many NGOs are not able to afford commercial, 
                non-pirated software. Furthermore, these organizations cannot 
                afford costly database development projects. The Martus commitment 
                to open source will allow Martus client software to be disseminated 
                throughout the human rights community free of charge and without 
                concern for piracy.</li>
              <li> Open source means that Martus users can get technical support 
                from where they choose. Because the users will have free, licensed 
                versions of Martus client software, they&#8217;ll be able to seek 
                assistance when software problems arise.</li>

            <h4><a name="12"></a>What is encryption, and why is it important? 
            </h4>
            <p> Encryption is a central component in the preservation of human 
              rights violation information. Martus software &#8211; on the client 
              side &#8211; will incorporate encryption capabilities to maintain 
              the integrity and security of the bulletins created and reported 
              by NGOs. This encryption takes place at the initial stage of bulletin 
              creation and before it is transmitted over the Internet. </p>
            <p>Human rights groups have used cryptography on a limited basis, 
              but currently available technology such as PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) 
              has not become widely successful because of its complexity. Martus 
              provides the simplest possible interface for encryption, while using 
              strong technology inside its tools.</p>
            <p> The goal of using this encryption technology is to give to the 
              NGOs various methods for protecting the information collected, based 
              on best-of-breed Information Technology practices. The benefits 
              Martus provides will go well beyond peace of mind to include secure 
              storage, offsite replication, and information sharing technologies 
              &#8211; all with transparent encryption technology.</p>

            <h3>Martus Implementation Plans</h3>
            <h4><a name="13"></a>How will Martus be adopted? </h4>
            <p> Following the 12-month development phase ending in December 2002, 
              Martus will be introduced to the human rights community through 
              outreach and training over a three-year period. We will pursue media 
              coverage to help ensure that Martus is introduced to and used by 
              the widest possible range of organizations. Martus outreach, customer 
              support and training teams will represent Martus at human rights 
              conferences internationally and to NGOs that express interest in 
              Martus. </p>
            <p>We will also approach NGOs individually to help them adopt Martus 
              as an information management application. In addition, we will approach 
              human rights information users and aggregators to demonstrate how 
              the Martus Amplifier will assist them in researching, analyzing 
              and distributing violation information.</p>
            <p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
            <h4><a name="14"></a>How much will Martus cost? </h4>
            <p> The Martus software will be disseminated throughout the human 
              rights community free of charge.</p>
            <p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
            <h4><a name="15"></a>Who will provide the training and outreach to 
              NGOs throughout the world? </h4>
            <p> During the initial rollout, Martus staff will provide training 
              and installation services at no charge for the initial adopter groups 
              that can't afford to pay for these services. Martus needs to achieve 
              critical mass to have the widest impact, and providing these direct 
              services to beta and early users is required to build the core user 
              base. </p>
            <p>Benetech does not see training as our core area of competence, 
              so our training efforts will be focused on &quot;train-the-trainer&quot; 
              as soon as practical. Our hope is that Martus technology becomes 
              part of the core toolkit of NGO technology staff, and that Benetech 
              training efforts can be phased out. At that point, the community 
              of Martus users will grow exponentially each year, and the reliance 
              on professional outreach by Martus staff will decrease.</p>

            <h4><a name="16" id="16"></a>What is the current status of the project? 
            </h4>
            <p> Martus has been built &#8211; as of November 2002 the finishing 
              touches are being put on the Martus Client and Backup Server software. 
              The Martus Amplifier, which will allow groups to publish the public 
              portions of bulletins to the Internet in searchable formats, commences 
              development in November 2002 and is expected to be available in 
              prototype form by second calendar quarter 2003.</p>
