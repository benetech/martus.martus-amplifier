----------------------------------------------------

I. Set up the Martus Amplifier Server. 
Copy martus-amplifier/tools/MartusServer to C:\

Do the same for martus-amplifier/tools/Martus_Amplifier_Folder.

II. Start the servers.

1. Start Tomcat using the Start Tomcat toolbar button.

2. Go to "Run"->"Run...".

3. Under "Launch Configurations" select "Java Application" and "New".

4. Fill in the following fields:

	Name: MartusAmplifierServer
	Project: martus
	Main class: org.martus.server.foramplifiers.MartusAmplifierServer

5. Run it. At the console, you will be prompted for a passphrase. 
Enter "ivo" and hit Enter. Wait until it prints 
"Waiting for connection..."

6. Now run the MartusAmplifier. To do this, follow instructions 
2 - 5, using the following for the Launch Configuration fields:

	Name: MartusAmplifier
	Project: martus-amplifier
	Main class: org.martus.amplifier.main.MartusAmplifier

7. These Launch Configurations are now saved and can be used for
