Instructions for Running the Amplifier from Eclipse
----------------------------------------------------

I. Set up the Martus Amplifier Server. 
Copy martus-amplifier/tools/MartusServer to C:\ 
(or whatever your local file system root is on Windows). 
Do the same for martus-amplifier/tools/Martus_Amplifier_Folder.

II. Start the servers.

2. Go to "Run"->"Run...".

3. Under "Launch Configurations" select "Java Application" and "New".

4. Fill in the following fields:

	Name: MartusAmplifierServer
	Project: martus
	Main class: org.martus.server.foramplifiers.MartusAmplifierServer

5. Run it. At the console, you will be prompted for a passphrase. 
Enter the appropriate passphrase for that server and hit Enter. 
Wait until it prints "Waiting for connection..."

5.5 You must configure the Amplifier to use the public key of the 
MartusAmplifierServer you are running. Copy the "Server Account" 
string out of the MartusServerAmplifier output, and paste it into 
the martus-amplifier/configuration/BackupServers.properties file
as the serverPublicKey entry. This only needs to be done the first 
time, or if the backup server public key changes.

6. Now run the MartusAmplifier. To do this, follow instructions 
2 - 5, using the following for the Launch Configuration fields:

	Name: MartusAmplifier
	Project: martus-amplifier
	Main class: org.martus.amplifier.main.JettyAmplifier

7. These Launch Configurations are now saved and can be used for 
future executions of these programs.
