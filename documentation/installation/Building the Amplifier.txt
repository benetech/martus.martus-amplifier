Instructions for Building the Amplifier from Eclipse
----------------------------------------------------

1. Compilation: Eclipse can be set up to automatically build java sources. You can also manually build amplifier or martus-readonly by selecting the project you want to build and selecting "Rebuild Project" from the popup menu.

2. As far as I can tell, Eclipse only supports java compilation as part of a build. If you want to do other things as part of a build, such as creating jar files, you have to do that yourself. Eclipse has some support for running Ant, though, so I've used this to handle the other necessary build tasks for Amplifier. Currently, this consists of jar-ing up the martus common source files and putting it and some 3rd-party jars in the WEB-INF/lib directory. It also includes copying the amp.tld, representing amplifier custom tags, into the WEB-INF directory. This build script is at martus-amplifier/build.xml. Select it in the Resource perspective, right click for the popup menu, and select Run Ant.... Select the "build" target and click Finish.

3. After performing these steps you should be able to run and test the Amplifier. See "Running the Amplifier" and "Testing the Amplifier".
